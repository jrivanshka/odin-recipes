    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It is a kneaded dough composed of flour, water and salt, sometimes supplemented with eggs.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg of flour.</li>
        <li>Water.</li>
        <li>Salt.</li>
        <li>Oil.</li>
        <li>Wooden Spoon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the flour in a bowl, add one tablespoon of salt and mix.</li>
        <li>Add water and mix with a spoon until the flour is slighty wet. It does NOT have to be a thin, unified dough.</li>
        <li>Heat a pot with a generous stream of oil.</li>
        <li>When the oil is very hot. Put the preparation in the pot. Left for about 5 minutes and then start stirring from the bottom up with a flat wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot, and after 5 minutes, uncover and stir again always from the bottom up.</li>
        <li>Step with the spoon as if giving small blows so that the largest pieces of dough shrink. Do this process a couple of times until you see that it begins to turn golden and have small pieces. Regulate the fire so you don't get burned.</li>
    </ol>
